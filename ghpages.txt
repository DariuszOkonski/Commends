> npm install gh-pages

at package.json dependencies:
"gh-pages": ^2.0.1
"homepage": "http..." => first line, 

at scripts:
"predeploy": "npm run build"
"deploy" : "gh-pages -d build"

if there is problem with routes on github when using Router add:

<Router basename={process.env.PUBLIC_URL} >
</Router>
